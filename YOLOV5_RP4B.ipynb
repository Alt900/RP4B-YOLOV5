    "## Scope and overview\n",
    "The goal of this project is to create a mobile platform for relatively powerful object detection models like the YOLOV5 model used here. Raspberry Pi’s are notoriously minimalistic in its hardware and that philosophy is reflected in their lite operating system versions. For that reason I chose to work on a CLI only 64 bit lite OS on a Raspberry Pi 4B in order to reserve as much computational space as possible for the YOLOV5 model to maximize performance. In order to achieve a visualization on a CLI only operating system I combined YOLOV5 with XVFB framebuffer to render OpenCV's output and a Real VNC server to view the output of XVFB-OpenCV from another Raspberry Pi.\n",
